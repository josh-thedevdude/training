Query:

SELECT * FROM bookings
WHERE doctor_id = ?
AND appointment_date >= ?
AND appointment_date <= ?;

Composite Index:
(doctor_id, appointment_date)
The default indexing method is B-Tree which respects the order of the indexed attributes which is Left to Right.
In the above query "doctor_id" being first should be indexed first then appointment_date.
